[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/dgriffen/Blog/_apis/build/status/dgriffen.SdkDemoVsix?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/dgriffen/Blog/_build/latest?definitionId=5&branchName=master)

This repository contains the code for the blog post _converting your VSIX project to an SDK style project_.

Since the post covers converting a project from one project system to another you will find the code in two branches. The "before" branch contains the code at the beginning of the post and the "after" branch contains the code at the end.
